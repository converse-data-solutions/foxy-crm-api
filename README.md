## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Migration Strategy

The application uses TypeORM migrations with a multi-tenant schema-per-organization model.

### Data Sources
- **Base App Data Source** (`base-app-data-source.ts`):  
  Handles global entities and base migrations.
- **Core Data Source** (`core-app-data-source.ts`):  
  Handles core app entities and related migrations.

### Tenant Onboarding Flow
When a new tenant is created via `tenantSetup()`:
1. A new PostgreSQL schema is created if it does not exist.  
2. The schema is set as the active search path.  
3. TypeORM runs all migrations for that schema using `dataSource.runMigrations()`.  
4. A default admin user is seeded into that tenant’s schema.  

### How Migrations Are Applied
- **Base migrations**: automatically executed when the NestJS application starts.  
  - If all base tables already exist, the migrations are skipped.  
  - If any base tables are missing, pending migrations are applied automatically.
- **Tenant migrations**: executed dynamically when a new tenant is created through `tenantSetup()`.

### Notes
- Each tenant has its own PostgreSQL schema with isolated data and migration history.  
- The base and core schemas are managed separately to ensure clean modularization.  
- This approach ensures automatic consistency without requiring manual migration commands during deployment.


## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
